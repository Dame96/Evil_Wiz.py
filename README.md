# Evil_Wiz.py


Hello World..welcome to my "Evil Wizard" CLI game! 

My motivation was to use the concepts of the Python language that I have been studying to create a fun interactive CLI game 
so I built this program. Utilizing the OOP Priciples, conditional statements and loops I was able to successfully
achiecve the goal. 

Features Include: 
1. Selecting from 1 of 4 characters.
2. Selecting options between attacking, using a special ability that varies with each character, healing up, and viewing your current status and that of your opponent. 

After a series of turns the winner will be declared! Choose your character wisely and good luck!
